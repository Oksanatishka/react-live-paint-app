We’ll be using these four tools to build our application:
1) Express
2) Node
3) Pusher
4) React

> npx create-react-app react-live-paint-app

> npm install express body-parser dotenv pusher     // install depencies required to build the server
> npm install pusher-js uuid    // front-end dependencies
> npm start     // open on http://localhost:3000. 

$$ BUILDING OUR SERVER
- Create server.js
- Create a Pusher account and a new Pusher Channels app if you haven’t done so yet and get your appId, keyand secret.
- Create .env
> node server   // Start the server 

$$ DRAW ROUTE
- Create a post route named draw in server.js

$$ CANVAS COMPONENT
- Create /src/canvas.js
- Add the canvas element to the App.js
- Add styles to the App.css
- Include a link to the stylesheet with external font in the /public/index.html
> npm start

$$ INTRODUCING PUSHER AND REALTIME PAINTING
- Open canvas.js, import the Pusher library into it, initialize it in the constructor and listen for events.

$$ TEST APPLICATION
Open two browsers side by side to observe the realtime functionality of the application. A line drawn on one browser should show up on the other.
Note: Ensure both the server and the dev server are up by running npm start and node server on separate terminal sessions.
